*Bolt* is a implementation of modal editing that tries to provide an instinctively correct modal editing interface without
shadowing Emacs powerful ecosystem.

This package is highly experimental, Bolt is constantly evolving and won't shy away from
breaking keybindings, or functionality.

* Modes

*Bolt* implements a subset of (Neo-)vims modes, and a few additional ones.

** Normal Mode

Just like Vim, the Normal mode does not allow insertion of text. This mode is mainly centered around
navigating your source-code and transforming it.

** Insert Mode

Insert mode enables the user to type and remove text within the buffer.

** Visual Mode

Visual mode allows users to quickly select and transform text.
